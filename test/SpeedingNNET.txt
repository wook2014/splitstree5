This file is just a record of profiling/speedups underway on the NNET least squares code.

We are opening

nucleic_M2573_346x897_2006_edit.phy

and constructing a NeighborNet.

On my MacBook Air (9/1/22) nnls computation took 36681 ms.

Profiler indicated that distances2splits.neighbornet.NeighborNetPCG.VectorUtilities.normSquared is a bottleneck.

* Replaced x[i]*x[i] with xi*xi (No effect, so left as is)
* Replaced with IntelliJ refactor: double ss= IntStream.range(1, x.length).mapToDouble(i -> x[i] * x[i]).sum();  (Doubled the time, so left as is)

Suspect that normSquared is highlighted just because it appears twice in the CG loop.

Added output of iterations and number of negative indices to block pivot. It requires 20 calls to CircularLeastSquares with 

public double pcgTol = 1e-4; 
public double finalTol = 1e-4; 
public double vectorCutoff = 1e-5;
	
Reduced vectorCutoff to 1e-3, and it crashed network drawing (too many splits?)

Tightened bounds 

public double pcgTol = 1e-6; //Tol
public double finalTol = 1e-6; //T
public double vectorCutoff = 1e-7;

with very little impact on total running time. However noticed that least squares (DualPCG) becomes a lot slower when the active set gets larger - range from 50ms to 2.8s.  Checked the effect of turning off preconditioning, and saw that there was none! So turned it on. Algorithm failed.

Turns out the problem is a numerical round-off problem with the inversion of the tridiagonal matrices. This is likely to be an issue with all large problem sizes. Exploring the problem in Matlab, but suspect that it makes sense to replace X with X + \lambda I for some regularisation term \lambda. 

It turns out that the problem lies with underflow in the calculation of the v and w vectors when doing the fancy tridiagonal inverse. Fixing this using the underflow hack of maintaining a separate exponential factor. I've done this with exp( ), whereas some efficiency could be gained using powers of two.

Tested this with the TriDiagonalMatrix.test() and seems to be working, however the preconditioner still isn't. 

Plan from here:
	Turn off the preconditioner for now
	Explore use of dual and primal CG 
	Noticed that dual CG seems to be maxing out. Why?
