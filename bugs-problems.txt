 - Error by parsing partial trees in IO part :
   nexus blocks with partial trees have false "isPartial" value

 - SuperNetwork in SplitsTree4 uses a DimensionFilter
   applied after splits computation, the final splits from ST4 are not the same

 - No output of confidences from ST4?

 - BalancedConfidenceNetwork can not open tree6.nex in ST4
   all confidences are 0.0

 - Problem by reading microsat character data
   StateLabeler isn't set

 - Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)
   RAPD data (?) for Upholt and Nei Li

 - optionLeastSquare in SuperNetwork is not used?

 - Nei Miller in ST4 doesn't work
