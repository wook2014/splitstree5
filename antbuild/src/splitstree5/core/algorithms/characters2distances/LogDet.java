/**
 * Calculation of the LogDet transform.
 * <p>
 * Created on  2008-03-17
 *
 * @author bryant
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The standard formula that we use for computing log det distances is
 * \[d_{xy} = -1/r ln(\frac{ det F_{xy} }{\sqrt{det(\Pi_x \Pi_y)}}\]
 * which is formula (23) on page 460 of Swofford et al.
 * <p/>
 * Taking the log of the determinant is numerically unstable, so instead we compute
 * trace(log(F_xy)) using an eigenvalue decomposition of F_xy.
 * <p/>
 * Both ways of computing log det will run into problems when F has zero or negative
 * eigenvalues. To avoid this, the implementation of logDet in LDDist makes some rather arbitrary
 * modifications to the F_xy matrix. These might be especially useful in protein log Det, where
 * it can often happen that rows or columns of F_xy are all zero. It seems to me that there are
 * better ways of dealing with that (e.g. using logDet on a subset of states), but that
 * requires a lot of further investigation that, given general problems of distance based methods,
 * might not be worth it.
 * <p/>
 * Here is a description of the fudge factor as I've interpreted it from LdDist code:
 * <p/>
 * Let F_{xy}[i,j] be the number of sites with an i for x and a j for y.
 * <p/>
 * for each state i, let \f_x[i] be the number of sites in x with state i. Likewise for \f_y[i].
 * let m_x[i] be the number of sites where x has an i and y has a missing or gap.
 * let m_y[i] be the number of sites where y has an i and x has a missing or gap.
 * <p/>
 * For each pair of states i,j multiply F_{xy}[i,j] by (1.0 + m_x[i]/f_x[i] + m_y[j]/f_y[j])
 * <p/>
 * I'm not quite sure why we don't just add m_x[i]/f_x[i] + m_y[j]/f_y[j] to F_{xy}, as this would correspond
 * to 'allocating' the sites  i -- gap  over the different pairs (i,1),...,(i,r) according to the total frequencies.
 * <p/>
 * The next step is to replace zero elements in F_{xy}[i,j] by 0.5. This is, I guess, imputing missing values,
 * but it won't solve the problem of zero rows or columns.
 * <p/>
 * Finally, we rescale F so that its entries sum to 1.0.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * ToDo: come up with a better way to do this.
 * <p/>
 * The other option involves the use of invariable sites. These can be estimated using the 'Estimate' button (we
 * use the capture-recapture method because it is fast and easy to implement), or you can plug in values from
 * Quartet puzzling or Phyml. Note that pvar is the proportion of variable sites, which is 1.0 minus the proportion
 * of invariable sites. Maybe we should change this.
 * <p/>
 * The formula we use is identical to 'Method 2' in the thesis of Peter Waddell. Namely, let pi[i] denote the
 * estimated frequency for state i and let p be the proportion of invariable sites. Using F (fudged or not) we compute
 * V = (F - p \Pi)
 * where \Pi is the diagonal matrix with \pi_i values down the diagonal. We then replace F by V in the formula above.
